# DABBiT – Drift-Adaptive Behavioral Biometrics Framework  
### Continuous Authentication Under Concept Drift (Keystroke & Mouse Dynamics)

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and documentation supporting **DABBiT**, a drift-adaptive behavioral biometrics framework for continuous authentication in internet banking environments.

> **Raw datasets are NOT stored in this repository** due to privacy restrictions.


## Background

DABBiT introduces:

- A **Causal Taxonomy of Concept Drift** for behavioral biometrics  
- A **drift-aware adaptive authentication pipeline**  
- An **adversarial simulation layer**  
- Multi-modal fusion: **keystroke + mouse + contextual signals**  
- Prototype extension toward **federated learning** for distributed banking systems  

The conceptual taxonomy was formalized in the paper:

**Festus Edward Ndalama, Patrick Mutabazi, Yuzo Taenaka, Youki Kadobayashi,  
“DABBiT: A Drift-Adaptive Behavioral Biometrics Framework for Continuous Authentication in Tanzanian Internet Banking,”  
AAIML 2026.**

- **Taxonomy PDF (high-resolution)**

More technical documentation will be added as the framework evolves.
